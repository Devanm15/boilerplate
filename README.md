# Welcome to the Earth Medicine App!

This app was created with the intention to improve education around traditional communities and their relationships to medicinal plant. The app shows an interactive map with indigenous cultures and plants to demonstrate the closeness of human cultures with the natural world around us.

This app is designed to be a platform for the community to contribute and share knowledge.

##Stack
Reactjs
Axios
Ruby on Rails
AntDesign

##Future Features
I hope to include a community chat platform where users can connect and share knowledge

In the future I may also want to include a platform for users to promote their own work with medicinal plants, fundraisers for the communities and plant restoration projects

As the plant portion of the app develops I hope to include information about endangerment, traditional practices with the plants and possibly recipes.
